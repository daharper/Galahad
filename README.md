# Project Galahad

*Developed for Delphi Florence.*

Modern engineering types for Delphi, allowing Clean Architecture and best practices.

The repository should take shape over the next few weeks, in the meantime there will be lots of churn.

I'm currently:

- Pulling code from a personal project
- Clarifying policies
- Refactoring as required
- Incrementally updating this repository

Once the dust settles, I'll provide documentation.

The name **Galahad** was chosen after King Arthur's knight, pure and of great integrity, who sought the Holy Grail.

The Holy Grail, in this sense, is maintainable code. 

**Project Galahad** aims to be a minimal and opinionated set of types ordered to clean code.

The goal is to augment, not compete with, existing frameworks. The project is exploratory in nature.

For a more complete and powerful framework, see the battle-hardened *Spring4D*.
