# Project Galahad

Modern engineering types for Delphi, allowing Clean Architecture and best practices.

Pulling code from an existing project, refactoring and polishing as required, and adding to this repository.

Developed for Delphi Florence.

The name Galahad was chosen after King Arthur's knight, who was pure and of great integrity. 

He alone succeeded in finding the Holy Grail. 

The Holy Grail in this sense, is clean and maintainable code. 

It aims to be a minimal and opinionated framework.

For a more complete and powerful framework, see the battle-hardened Spring4D.
