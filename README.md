# Project Galahad

Modern engineering types for Delphi, allowing Clean Architecture and best practices.

Should take shape over the next few weeks, I'm currently:

- Pulling code from a personal project
- Refactoring and polishing as required
- Adding to this repository.

*Developed for Delphi Florence.*

The name **Galahad** was chosen after King Arthur's knight, pure and of great integrity, who sought the Holy Grail.

The Holy Grail in this sense, is maintainable code. 

It aims to be a minimal and opinionated set of types ordered to clean code.

For a more complete and powerful framework, see the battle-hardened *Spring4D*.
